# Backend Modernization Summary

## Problems Identified

1. **SQLite Dependency** – Application logic had already started moving toward PostgreSQL, but dependencies, scripts, and schema files still referenced SQLite.
2. **Out-of-date Setup Flow** – Multiple shell scripts and docs conflicted, making it unclear how to bootstrap a clean environment.
3. **Environment Drift** – `.env.example` did not reflect the variables consumed by the code and by server-side integrations.

## Implemented Changes

### Database Layer (`lib/database.ts`)
- Replaced the SQLite client with a pooled PostgreSQL connection (`pg`).
- Normalized JSON parsing and UUID generation for teams and reports.
- Simplified transactional deletes and ensured dates/numbers map cleanly from Postgres rows.

### Schema & Tooling
- Rebuilt `init-database.sql` as a Postgres script with UUID primary keys and JSONB columns.
- Converted `database-migration.sql` into a Postgres-friendly template for future migrations.
- Added `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` to document tables and relationships.

### Developer Experience
- Refreshed `.env.example` with the new configuration surface (database, Telegram, Google Sheets, admin).
- Replaced the old SQLite setup workflow with a single Postgres-aware script (`setup-fresh-database.sh`).
- Stubbed `setup-template-system.sh` to point to the new workflow, keeping backwards compatibility.
- Updated `README.md` to describe the Postgres migration and onboarding steps.

## Next Actions

1. Regenerate `package-lock.json` by running `npm install` so the repository lockfile matches the new dependencies (`pg`, `@types/pg`).
2. Verify all serverless/API routes against a live Postgres instance and add integration tests.
3. Remove any remaining UI assumptions tied to the legacy SQLite dates or schema if encountered during testing.
